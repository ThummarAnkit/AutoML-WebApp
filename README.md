# AutoML-WebApp
An Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) Web App that allows users to perform end-to-end ML workflows directly from the browser. This project was developed collaboratively with my teammates during Internship at Renu Sharma Foundation. This repository contains the full codebase (frontend + backend) along with additional Jupyter notebooks that showcase the core logic and functions we developed for the AutoML pipeline.
